## Project 1

# This is my first Expreiment with p5.js

Here I chose to use the moire effect and create 3 expreiments showing what it is and how it is made.

# Here is the code:
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  stroke(0);
  noFill();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  let spacing = 20;
  
  // Static grid
  for (let x = 0; x < width; x += spacing) {
    line(x, 0, x, height);
  }

  // Rotating grid
  push();
  translate(width / 2, height / 2);
  rotate(radians(frameCount * 0.2)); // slow rotation
  for (let x = -width; x < width; x += spacing) {
    line(x, -height, x, height);
  }
  pop();
}

Here is the second project of the three using the moire effect:

# Here is the code
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  noFill();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width/2, height/2);

  let offset = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 10); // mouse controls offset

  for (let r = 20; r < width; r += 20) {
    ellipse(0, 0, r, r); // base set
    ellipse(offset, offset, r, r); // offset set
  }
}

Here is the final project of the three using the moire effect:

# Here is the code
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  stroke(0);
  noFill();
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  let lines = 30;
  let spacing = height / lines;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < lines; i++) {
    beginShape();
    for (let x = 0; x < width; x += 10) {
      let y = i * spacing + sin(x * 0.05 + frameCount * 0.05 + i) * 10;
      vertex(x, y);
    }
    endShape();
  }
}

Project 1 Commentary:

For this first project I made 3 variations of the moire effect, and this effect is
when two similar, but not identical patterns overlap and intertwine with one another
usually with a wavy and ripple like pattern. In my code I have used several techniques
to make it creative and use the moire effect in a unique way that catches attention
when looked at. An example of this can be found where I used the draw() tool which has
a function that it runs continuously and will clear the screen each time with a white background, 
this function allows my image to have a constant and instantaneous generation of new 
patterns and or images/ effects. 

Another part of the code that I used to showcase 
the moire effect would be using the push() and pop() function which are used so I can isolate 
each shape and as push() creates a new group for transformations whilst pop() ends the drawing group,
the transformation I chose was rotate which gave an effect that the image was moving every time 
only slightly to create a unique and interesting effect. The inspiration for me to create 
this was an online tutorial discussing what the moire effect is, and I found it intriguing,
so I chose to learn how to create it myself.

To reflect on my creation using the moire effect
I consider that it was a difficult task to create as it involves different techniques to
be able to work and output an interesting moire effect. However, I would also say that I did 
create 3 unique moire effect patterns that are eye-catching and follow the convention of the 
moire effect as the shapes/ patterns are similar but not identical and they overlap and 
create a new pattern. In addition to this I did use techniques that were more complex and advanced 
such as the ellipse() tool which draws an oval shape, and I also used the vertex() function which 
creates a customised shape based on coordinates of the page using the x and y axis to determine
where the shape will be drawn using the beginShape() function.
