Here is the second project that I made

In this project I created a brush that can use 4 different brush styles to paint on a canvas 

I created a code that uses keys from '1 to 4' from the keyboard to change the brush style as it is effective and fast for the user.

# Here is the code
let brushType = 1;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  background(255);
}

function draw() {
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    if (brushType === 1) {
      // Basic round brush
      fill(0);
      noStroke();
      ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
      
    } else if (brushType === 2) {
      // Soft spray brush
      noStroke();
      fill(0, 50); // transparent black
      for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        let offsetX = random(-10, 10);
        let offsetY = random(-10, 10);
        ellipse(mouseX + offsetX, mouseY + offsetY, 2);
      }

    } else if (brushType === 3) {
      // Line brush (streak)
      stroke(0);
      strokeWeight(3);
      line(pmouseX, pmouseY, mouseX, mouseY);

    } else if (brushType === 4) {
      // Square pixel brush
      noStroke();
      fill(0);
      rect(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10);
    }
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
  if (key === '1') brushType = 1;
  if (key === '2') brushType = 2;
  if (key === '3') brushType = 3;
  if (key === '4') brushType = 4;
}

Project 2 Commentary:

For this project I decided to create a Mouse painting tool that has up to 4 brushes with
a different style for each brush. In this code I decided to use simple yet effective functions
and tools such as the ellipse(), line() and rect() tools, I chose these because they
are a fun way with lots of user interaction and engagement.

Each brush has a different 
style or brush effect for example, brush 1 has a solid black dot effect, similar to a 
regular pen or whiteboard pen, brush 2 creates a light spray effect using small dots to 
create a pattern by following the mouse input and movement. Brush 3 uses a very thin and precise
pen like a fountain pen which is great for sketching or writing short words and lastly, brush 4 is similar
to brush 1 as it uses black squares instead of black circles to create images and this 
can give the user a more pixel-art style. I was inspired to make this project from the list 
as it reminded me of Microsoft paint which I have experience with as I have used it in school 
before university, this was inspiring because I have always wondered how it was made on that 
and I enjoyed creating a similar style that was user engaging and creative. 

In my development 
process I used multiple different functions such as if(mouseIsPressed) which was the input of the 
mouse being clicked and this would then allow the output of a black line in each style depending on 
whichever of the 1-4 keys was selected by the user. Also, I used the else if (brushType === 1) tool and 
this would allow me to allocate each key from 1-4 to a different font style or 
design as I mentioned before with each key and what style it outputs. 

In this project I believe 
that it went well as it used more advanced code levels that I researched into to create and 
using these effectively can create a simple and engaging project. However, I feel that I could
have made it more interesting such as adding multiple colours or made the keys output a different
style that was more unique potentially, this could have made this project better
and given it a different aesthetic towards the user which is something
I would consider changing for next time.
