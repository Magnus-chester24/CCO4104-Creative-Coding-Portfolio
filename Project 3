In this Project I have created an autonomous pattern generator that creates a random and new unique pattern each time the page refreshes

# Here is the code
function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 600);
  background(255);
  noLoop(); // Run only once to generate a unique image
  noStroke();

  let shapes = int(random(100, 200)); // number of shapes varies each run

  for (let i = 0; i < shapes; i++) {
    let x = random(width);
    let y = random(height);
    let size = random(10, 100);
    
    // Random pastel color
    fill(random(100, 255), random(100, 255), random(100, 255), 100);
    
    // Random shape type
    let shapeType = int(random(3));
    
    if (shapeType === 0) {
      ellipse(x, y, size, size); // circle
    } else if (shapeType === 1) {
      rect(x, y, size, size); // square
    } else {
      triangle(x, y, x + size, y, x + size / 2, y - size); // triangle
    }
  }
}

Project 3 Commentary:
In this project I decided to create an autonomous pattern generator that creates a new
unique pattern each time the page refreshes. In this program I used the tool noLoop() and
this makes the program only draw one image and never repeat the same image and create something
new each time whether that be a different colour for a certain shape or position of the shape on
the white canvas. 

Mainly for this program I wanted to create something that had a random oriented
factor that made it something new every time and I did this by using the fill(random) tool and this
with allocating 2 numbers being 100 and 255 to create a random pastel colour for each box each time
the program restarts. I did the same for the shape by using the let shapeType = int(random this
similarly allowed the program to output a unique bunch of shapes onto the canvas with a different
colour across each shape to overall have a very random and abstract image. 
This was inspired to me by Tyler Hobbs as he used lots of randomness and he also is an infamous creative coder who uses
coding skills to create artistic imagery, I felt that this project specifically has an artistic 
impression due to its abstractness. In this project I think something that went well was the use of
complex coding techniques such as the ones I have previously mentioned before as these are simple yet
effective to implement as they are perfect to create a random and eccentric piece of imagery. 

Furthermore, I think that my code creates variety each time as it picks a random number of shapes 
between 100 and 200 which provides different levels of complexity for each sketch created. 
This is positive overall as it does in fact create a distinctive and exclusive pattern each time as the
code tells the program to never repeat the same pattern, so it is different every time. 
However, I also think that if I were to improve or create the project again, I would research into moving 
the shapes around the canvas potentially as it could create a motion effect for the user which they may find engaging.
